## 🔧 Features/TODO

if something you see here thats missing for a cool feature tell me

### highest priority
- make site responsive (imposible challenge)

  
### major features
- saving/exporting scenes (many different solutions available for this)

- a choice generator that you can use in the middle of ur scene
- an ending generator that you can use in the end of ur scene
- mobile support
### todo currently
- all characters/backgrounds from all 3 games including every clothing/expression option

- add ur own bgm/sound effects / ur own voicelines or whatever for each dialogue
- add ur own background/character sprite
- modify character size (useful for custom sprite)
- moving characters during scene (like after/before a dialogue plays u can animate the character to move)
- fix clothes being flipped so they dont reverse (would need 2 different sprites for each cloth)

### boring code stuff
- move to react  so this shit isnt awful to develop
- i need to start commenting LOL
